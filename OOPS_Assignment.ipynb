        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 1: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Orienred Programming is a programming apporoach that uses objects and classes.It's all about creating code that models real-world things aws object with properties and behaviours.OOP makes code more organizesd and reusable through principles like encapsulation,inheritance,polymorphism,and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Quiestion 2: What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is basically a blueprint for creating objects.Think of it like a template that defines what properties (attributes) and actions (methods) objects of that type will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 3: What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class-it's the actual thing created from the class blueprint.If a class is like a cookie cutterr,an object is like the cookie.Each object has it's own value for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 4: What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction and Encapsulation are releated but different:\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Abstraction is about simplifying complex reality by showing only what's necessary.It's like driving a car - I just need to know about the steering wheel and pedals,not the engine internal.\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods together and restricting access to internal details.It's like putting a protective shell around your object's data to control how it's accessed and modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both hide complexity,but abstraction is about simplification whikle encapsulation is about protection.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 5: What a dunder method in python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods(double underscore methods) are special built-in method in python that start and end with double underscores.they're also called a magic methods because they lety me define how your objects behave with built-in python operations.  Some common ones are:\n",
        "\n",
        "> _int_ for intializing bjects\n",
        "> _str_ for string reprtesentation\n",
        "> _len_ for getting length\n",
        "> _add_ for addition operation\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 6: Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance lets a class (child class) acquire the properties and methosds of another calss (parent class).It's a way to create new classes that are built upon existing classes.\n",
        "For example: If i have a vehicle claass,you could create a car and motorcycle classes that inherit from it.Both would get the common vehicle features,but i can add specific features to each child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 7: What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means \"many forms:\" and it allows objects of different types to be trated as objects of a common type.It's about using interface for different underlying implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 8: How is encapsulation achieved in python?\n",
        "- Python using naming conventions for encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular attributes/methodfs are public Names with a single underscore prefix (_name) suggest that they are protected (a convention) Names with double underscore (__name) are name -mangled to make them harder to access from outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 10: What is a constructor in python?\n",
        "- A constructor is the method that gets called when i created a new object.Inpython ,the _init_ method serves as the constructor.It intializes the new object with any attributes I want to set up from the start.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 11: What is method overloading in python?\n",
        "- Method overloading is having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.Python doesn't support traditional method overloading like some other languages.Instead ,i can simulate it by using default arguments,variable-length arguments (*args,**kwargs) or by checking the parameters type instead the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 12: What is method overriding in python?\n",
        "- Method overriding occurs whwn a child calss provides a specific implementation for a method that's already defined in its parent class.When i override method ,i replace the parent's implementation with my own in the child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Quiestion 13: What is a property decorator in python?\n",
        "- The property decorator(@property) let's me define methods that act like attributes.It's way to implement getters,setterts, and deleters for class attributes without changing how i access them in my code.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 14: Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important because it allows for:\n",
        "Code flexiblity and reusability writing more generic and abstract code implementing interfaces that can work with objects of different types extension of functionality withou modifying existing code it enables me to write a code that can operate an object of various classes as lomg as they support the same interface, which makes my code more modular and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 15: What is an abstract class in python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and designed to be subclassed.It often contains one aor more abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 16: What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- The main advantages of OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        " > Modularity: Code is organized into objects that can be maintained\n",
        "              seperately.\n",
        " > Reusability: Through inheritance and composition.\n",
        " > Miantainability: Changes in one part don't affect other parts.\n",
        " > Encapsulation: Data hiding prevents accidental modification.\n",
        " > Abstractor: Complex systems can be modeled at higher level.\n",
        " > Polymorphism: Same interface for different implementations.\n",
        " > Real-world modeling: Natural way to represent entities and their\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 17: What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- The key differences are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Variable:-\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Defined at the class level,outside any methods.\n",
        "  . shared among all instances of the class.\n",
        "  . accessed via Class.Variable or self.variable\n",
        "  . Memory efficient when the value should be the same for all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Variable:-\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Define inside methods,typically in init\n",
        "  . Unique to each instance of the class\n",
        "  . Accessed via self.variable\n",
        "  . Allow each object to have its own state.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 18: What is multiple inheritance in python?\n",
        "- Multiple Inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class.It allows a class to combime attributes and methods from multiple sources.Python uses the Method Resolution Order(MRO) and the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the order in which methods are resolved.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 19: Explain the purpose of 'str' and 'repr' methods in python?\n",
        "- Both methods return string represenrting of objects,but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "_str_: defines the \"informal\" string representation of an object.It's meant to be readable for end users and is called by str() and print().\n",
        "\n",
        "_repr_: Defines the \"official\" string representation of an objectIt should ideally contain information to recreate the object and is called by repr().\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 20: What is the significance of the 'super()' function in python?\n",
        "- The super() function allows me to call methods from a parent class.It's particularly useful in inheritance scenarios when i want to extend functionallity rather than completely replace it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 21: What is the significance of the del method in python>?\n",
        "- The _del_ method is a special method that works as a destructor in python.It's called when an object is about to be destroyed I can use it to handle cleanup operation like closing files,releasing resources resources,or disconnecting from databases.However,it's generally better to use context managers for resource mangement since_del_ isn't guaranteed to be called in all situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 22: What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in python?\n",
        "- The main differences are:\n",
        "\n",
        "@staticmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Doesn't take the mandatory first argument\n",
        "  . Cannot access or modify class state\n",
        "  . Behaves like a regular function but belongsto the class namespace\n",
        "  . Used for utility functions reletaed to the class but not dependent on class sate\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Takes the class itself as the first argument\n",
        "  . Can access and modify class variables\n",
        "  . Can be used as alternative constructors\n",
        "  . Works with inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 23: How does polymorphism work in python with inheritance?\n",
        "- In python,polymorphism with inheritance works through method overriding.When a subclass provides aspecific implementation for a method that's already defined in its parent class.I can use the subclass object whenever the parent class is ecpected,and the appropriate method implementation will be called.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 24: What is the method chaining in python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining is a programming pattern where i call multiple methods in sequence on the same object.Each method returns self, allowing me to chain anorther method call immediately after.This creates, mnore concise and readble code by reducing the need to repeat the object name.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 25: What is the purpose of the call method in python?\n",
        "- The call methods allows an object to be called like a function.When i define the method in a class,inheritances of that class become callable.This is useful for craeting function-like objects that maintain state between calls or have configurable behavior.\n",
